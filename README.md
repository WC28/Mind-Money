# 🇹🇭 Mind & Money: Mapping the Mental Health Impact of Unemployment in Thailand (2020–2025)

> 💡 A unique intersection of data science, social work, and mental health research — visualizing how economic instability affects the Thai population's well-being.

## 🧠 Overview
As Thailand continues to recover from the economic aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and suicide have become increasingly visible — especially among unemployed youth and vulnerable groups. This project analyzes publicly available data to explore:

- How rising unemployment correlates with mental health issues
- Which provinces and age groups are most at risk
- What social and digital health interventions may help

## 🎯 Project Goals
- 📊 Visualize unemployment trends vs. mental health indicators (2020–2025)
- 🗺 Identify high-risk provinces and demographics
- 🧩 Bridge clinical insights and social work theory (e.g. Maslow, biopsychosocial model)
- 💬 Offer real-world policy and digital health suggestions for mental health care delivery

## 📊 Datasets Used
- [กรมสุขภาพจิต (Thailand Department of Mental Health)](https://www.dmh.go.th)
- [สำนักงานสถิติแห่งชาติ (National Statistical Office)](http://www.nso.go.th)
- [World Bank Thailand Economic Indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/country/thailand)
- [WHO SEARO Mental Health Data](https://www.who.int/thailand)

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights
- **Correlation heatmaps** of suicide hotline calls vs. youth unemployment
- **Choropleth maps** of mental health service coverage by province
- **Trend analysis** of mental health symptoms reported vs. GDP growth and inflation
- **Demographic breakdowns** (e.g., women aged 20–30, low-income populations)

## 🧠 Theoretical Framework
This project integrates:
- 🧍 Biopsychosocial model of mental health
- 📉 Economic strain theory
- 🔺 Maslow’s Hierarchy (basic needs → mental distress)
- 📱 Role of digital health access & inequality

## 💡 Recommendations
Based on findings, we suggest:
- Expanding **tele-mental health services** to underserved provinces
- Proactive outreach to unemployed youth (18–25)
- Government investment in **job-linked mental health screening**
- Collaborations between hospitals, NGOs, and employment agencies

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python: `pandas`, `plotly`, `geopandas`, `seaborn`
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
- Tableau Public (optional)

## 📈 Sample Visualizations
> Coming soon in `/visualizations`

- ✅ Province-level mental health & unemployment heatmap
- ✅ Correlation graph: mental health hotline calls vs. jobless rate
- ✅ Time series of key indicators (2020–2025)

## 🌏 Why It Matters
Mental health is more than a clinical issue. It is a **social and economic emergency** in Thailand's post-COVID era. This project is built to:
- Empower decision-makers
- Raise awareness through open data
- Demonstrate the value of **integrated social work + digital health + data science**
